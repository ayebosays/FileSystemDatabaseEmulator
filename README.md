Part 2
The second part of this project requires that you implement a simple file system. In particular, you are going to write the software which which will handle dynamic file management. This part of the project will require you to implement the class Filesys along with member functions.

Part 3
In this part of the project, you are going to create a database system with a single table which uses the file system from Project II. The input file will consist of records associated with Art History. More info...
Part 4
In the final part of the project, you are going to augment the search function from the last project with a function that searches the database using a B-Tree index file to search over the primary key (year) of the database. Of course, to implement such a search it is necessary to first build the B-Tree. This part of the project is not complete, there are some bugs that i have not gotten to fix yet. Bugs are being fixed in the revised version.
